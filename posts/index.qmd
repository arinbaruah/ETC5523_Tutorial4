## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: fig-corr
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-cap: "MPG Vs Weight of cars"
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mtcars,aes(x = mpg,y = wt,color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point() + theme_classic() + labs(color = "Number of cylinders",x = "Miles/gallon",y = "Weight of vehicle") + ggtitle("Correlation between weight and mpg")
```

This is @fig-corr

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
